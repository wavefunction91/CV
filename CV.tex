\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
%	\item Provided supplimentary lecture instruction (quiz section) for the General Chemistry course series
%    as well as full instruction for the associated lab coursework. I was responsible for
%    the evaluation of students' performance both in lecture course work (exams, homework assignments)
%    as well as the lab (lab reports).
  \item Provided supplimentary lecture instruction for the undergraduate General Chemistry course series
    as well as full instruction for the associated lab coursework. This job entailed full responsibility
    for two sections of thirty students during a supplimental lecture series referred to as a quiz section.
    I was responsible for the evaluatoin of students' performance both in lecture coursework (exams, homework assignments)
    as well as the lab (lab reports).
  \item Provided supplimetary lecture instruction for the final lecture course (in a series of three) of
    the undergraduate Organic Chemisty course series. Primarily, I was responsible for evaluating students' performance on
    Exams. In addition, I was responsible for making myself available for course related questions through
    structured office hours.
  \item Aided in the development of new course material for the second lecture course (in a series of two),
    of the graduate Quantum Chemistry course series. The developed course material focused on the practical
    development of basic quatnum chemical methods, such as Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory, using
    the MATLAB development environment. The students developed, from scratch, a working implementation
    of these methods with the aid of provided course material developed by my self and the primary course
    instructor. For this course, I also had the primary responsibility for evaluating students' progress
    through the grading of exams and assigned course work.
